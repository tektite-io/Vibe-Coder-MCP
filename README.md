## Setup Guide

Follow these micro-steps to get the Vibe Coder MCP server running and connected to your AI assistant.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

1. **Check Node.js Version:**
   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   * Run `node -v`
   * Ensure the output shows v18.0.0 or higher (required).
   * If not installed or outdated: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Check Git Installation:**
   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   * Run `git --version`
   * If not installed: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

3. **Get OpenRouter API Key:**
   * Visit [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
   * Create an account if you don't have one.
   * Navigate to API Keys section.
   * Create a new API key and copy it.
   * Keep this key handy for Step 4.

### Step 2: Get the Code

1. **Create a Project Directory** (optional):
   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   * Navigate to where you want to store the project:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Documents     # Example: Change to your preferred location
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   * Run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/freshtechbro/vibe-coder-mcp.git
     ```
     (Or use your fork's URL if applicable)

3. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   * Run:
     ```bash
     cd vibe-coder-mcp
     ```

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

Choose the appropriate script for your operating system:

**For Windows:**
1. In your terminal (still in the vibe-coder-mcp directory), run:
   ```batch
   setup.bat
   ```
2. Wait for the script to complete (it will install dependencies, build the project, and create necessary directories).
3. If you see any error messages, refer to the Troubleshooting section below.

**For macOS or Linux:**
1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
3. Wait for the script to complete.
4. If you see any error messages, refer to the Troubleshooting section below.

The script performs these actions:
* Checks Node.js version (v18+)
* Installs all dependencies via npm
* Creates necessary `VibeCoderOutput/` subdirectories (as defined in the script).
* Builds the TypeScript project.
* **Copies `.env.example` to `.env` if `.env` doesn't already exist.** You will need to edit this file.
* Sets executable permissions (on Unix systems).

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables (`.env`)

The setup script (from Step 3) automatically creates a `.env` file in the project's root directory by copying the `.env.example` template, **only if `.env` does not already exist**.

1.  **Locate and Open `.env`:** Find the `.env` file in the main `vibe-coder-mcp` directory and open it with a text editor.

2.  **Add Your OpenRouter API Key (Required):**
    *   The file contains a template based on `.env.example`:
        ```dotenv
        # OpenRouter Configuration
        ## Specifies your unique API key for accessing OpenRouter services.
        ## Replace "Your OPENROUTER_API_KEY here" with your actual key obtained from OpenRouter.ai.
        OPENROUTER_API_KEY="Your OPENROUTER_API_KEY here"

        ## Defines the base URL for the OpenRouter API endpoints.
        ## The default value is usually correct and should not need changing unless instructed otherwise.
        OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

        ## Sets the specific Gemini model to be used via OpenRouter for certain AI tasks.
        ## ':free' indicates potential usage of a free tier model if available and supported by your key.
        GEMINI_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20
        ```
    *   **Crucially, replace `"Your OPENROUTER_API_KEY here"` with your actual OpenRouter API key.** Remove the quotes if your key doesn't require them.

3.  **Configure Output Directory (Optional):**
    *   To change where generated files are saved (default is `VibeCoderOutput/` inside the project), add this line to your `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/your/desired/output/directory
        ```
    *   Replace the path with your preferred **absolute path**. Use forward slashes (`/`) for paths. If this variable is not set, the default directory (`VibeCoderOutput/`) will be used.

4.  **Configure Code-Map Generator Directory (Optional):**
    *   To specify which directory the map-codebase tool is allowed to scan, add this line to your `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        CODE_MAP_ALLOWED_DIR=/path/to/your/source/code/directory
        ```
    *   Replace the path with the **absolute path** to the directory containing the source code you want to analyze. This is a security boundary - the tool will not access files outside this directory.

5.  **Configure Vibe Task Manager Read Directory (Optional):**
    *   To specify which directory the Vibe Task Manager is allowed to read from for security purposes, add this line to your `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        VIBE_TASK_MANAGER_READ_DIR=/path/to/your/project/source/directory
        ```
    *   Replace the path with the **absolute path** to the directory containing your project files that the task manager should have access to.
    *   **Default Value**: If not specified, defaults to `process.cwd()` (the current working directory where the server is running).
    *   **Security**: This variable works with the filesystem security implementation that defaults to 'strict' mode, preventing access to system directories and unauthorized paths.
    *   **Note**: `VIBE_TASK_MANAGER_READ_DIR` (for task manager file operations), `CODE_MAP_ALLOWED_DIR` (for code analysis), and `VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR` (for writing output files) are separate security boundaries for different tool operations.

6.  **Review Other Settings (Optional):**
    *   You can add other environment variables supported by the server, such as `LOG_LEVEL` (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL=debug`) or `NODE_ENV` (e.g., `NODE_ENV=development`).

7.  **Save the `.env` File.**

### Step 5: Integrate with Your AI Assistant (MCP Settings)

This crucial step connects Vibe Coder to your AI assistant by adding its configuration to the client's MCP settings file.

#### 5.1: Locate Your Client's MCP Settings File

The location varies depending on your AI assistant:

*   **Cursor AI / Windsurf / RooCode (VS Code based):**
    1.  Open the application.
    2.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    3.  Type and select `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.
    4.  This opens your `settings.json` file where the `mcpServers` object should reside.

*   **Cline AI (VS Code Extension):**
    *   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json`
    *   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
    *   **Linux**: `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
    *   *(Note: If using standard VS Code instead of Cursor, replace `Cursor` with `Code` in the path)*

*   **Claude Desktop:**
    *   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

#### 5.2: Add the Vibe Coder Configuration

1.  Open the settings file identified above in a text editor.
2.  Find the `"mcpServers": { ... }` JSON object. If it doesn't exist, you may need to create it (ensure the overall file remains valid JSON). For example, an empty file might become `{"mcpServers": {}}`.
3.  Add the following configuration block **inside** the curly braces `{}` of the `mcpServers` object. If other servers are already listed, add a comma `,` after the previous server's closing brace `}` before pasting this block.

    ```json
    // This is the unique identifier for this MCP server instance within your client's settings
    "vibe-coder-mcp": {
      // Specifies the command used to execute the server. Should be 'node' if Node.js is in your system's PATH
      "command": "node",
      // Provides the arguments to the 'command'. The primary argument is the absolute path to the compiled server entry point
      // !! IMPORTANT: Replace with the actual absolute path on YOUR system. Use forward slashes (/) even on Windows !!
      "args": ["/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP/build/index.js"],
      // Sets the current working directory for the server process when it runs
      // !! IMPORTANT: Replace with the actual absolute path on YOUR system. Use forward slashes (/) even on Windows !!
      "cwd": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP",
      // Defines the communication transport protocol between the client and server
      "transport": "stdio",
      // Environment variables to be passed specifically to the Vibe Coder server process when it starts
      // API Keys should be in the .env file, NOT here
      "env": {
        // Absolute path to the LLM configuration file used by Vibe Coder
        // !! IMPORTANT: Replace with the actual absolute path on YOUR system !!
        "LLM_CONFIG_PATH": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP/llm_config.json",
        // Sets the logging level for the server
        "LOG_LEVEL": "debug",
        // Specifies the runtime environment
        "NODE_ENV": "production",
        // Directory where Vibe Coder tools will save their output files
        // !! IMPORTANT: Replace with the actual absolute path on YOUR system !!
        "VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP/VibeCoderOutput",
        // Directory that the map-codebase tool is allowed to scan
        // This is a security boundary - the tool will not access files outside this directory
        "CODE_MAP_ALLOWED_DIR": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP/src",
        // Directory that the Vibe Task Manager is allowed to read from for security purposes
        // Defaults to process.cwd() if not specified. Works with strict security mode by default.
        "VIBE_TASK_MANAGER_READ_DIR": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP"
      },
      // A boolean flag to enable (false) or disable (true) this server configuration
      "disabled": false,
      // A list of tool names that the MCP client is allowed to execute automatically
      "autoApprove": [
        "research",
        "generate-rules",
        "generate-user-stories",
        "generate-task-list",
        "generate-prd",
        "generate-fullstack-starter-kit",
        "refactor-code",
        "git-summary",
        "run-workflow",
        "map-codebase"
      ]
    }
    ```

4.  **CRUCIAL:** Replace **all placeholder paths** (like `/path/to/your/vibe-coder-mcp/...`) with the correct **absolute paths** on your system where you cloned the repository. Use forward slashes `/` for paths, even on Windows (e.g., `C:/Users/YourName/Projects/vibe-coder-mcp/build/index.js`). Incorrect paths are the most common reason the server fails to connect.
5.  Save the settings file.
6.  **Completely close and restart** your AI assistant application (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) for the changes to take effect.

### Step 6: Test Your Configuration

1. **Start Your AI Assistant:**
   * Completely restart your AI assistant application.

2. **Test a Simple Command:**
   * Type a test command like: `Research modern JavaScript frameworks`

3. **Check for Proper Response:**
   * If working correctly, you should receive a research response.
   * If not, check the Troubleshooting section below.

## Semantic Routing System

Vibe Coder uses a sophisticated routing approach to select the right tool for each request:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Client Request] --> Process[Process Request]
    Process --> Hybrid[Hybrid Matcher]

    subgraph "Primary: Semantic Routing"
        Hybrid --> Semantic[Semantic Matcher]
        Semantic --> Embeddings[Query Embeddings]
        Embeddings --> Tools[Tool Embeddings]
        Tools --> Compare[Compare via Cosine Similarity]
        Compare --> Score[Score & Rank Tools]
        Score --> Confidence{High Confidence?}
    end

    Confidence -->|Yes| Registry[Tool Registry]

    subgraph "Fallback: Sequential Thinking"
        Confidence -->|No| Sequential[Sequential Thinking]
        Sequential --> LLM[LLM Analysis]
        LLM --> ThoughtChain[Thought Chain]
        ThoughtChain --> Extraction[Extract Tool Name]
        Extraction --> Registry
    end

    Registry --> Executor[Execute Tool]
    Executor --> Response[Return Response]
```

## Tool Registry Pattern

The Tool Registry is a central component for managing tool definitions and execution:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Tool Registration (at import)"
        Import[Import Tool] --> Register[Call registerTool]
        Register --> Store[Store in Registry Map]
    end

    subgraph "Tool Definition"
        Def[ToolDefinition] --> Name[Tool Name]
        Def --> Desc[Description]
        Def --> Schema[Zod Schema]
        Def --> Exec[Executor Function]
    end

    subgraph "Server Initialization"
        Init[server.ts] --> Import
        Init --> GetAll[getAllTools]
        GetAll --> Loop[Loop Through Tools]
        Loop --> McpReg[Register with MCP Server]
    end

    subgraph "Tool Execution"
        McpReg --> ExecTool[executeTool Function]
        ExecTool --> GetTool[Get Tool from Registry]
        GetTool --> Validate[Validate Input]
        Validate -->|Valid| ExecFunc[Run Executor Function]
        Validate -->|Invalid| ValidErr[Return Validation Error]
        ExecFunc -->|Success| SuccessResp[Return Success Response]
        ExecFunc -->|Error| HandleErr[Catch & Format Error]
        HandleErr --> ErrResp[Return Error Response]
    end
```

## Sequential Thinking Process

The Sequential Thinking mechanism provides LLM-based fallback routing:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Estimate[Estimate Number of Steps]
    Estimate --> Init[Initialize with System Prompt]
    Init --> First[Generate First Thought]
    First --> Context[Add to Context]
    Context --> Loop{Needs More Thoughts?}

    Loop -->|Yes| Next[Generate Next Thought]
    Next -->|Standard| AddStd[Add to Context]
    Next -->|Revision| Rev[Mark as Revision]
    Next -->|New Branch| Branch[Mark as Branch]
    Rev --> AddRev[Add to Context]
    Branch --> AddBranch[Add to Context]
    AddStd --> Loop
    AddRev --> Loop
    AddBranch --> Loop

    Loop -->|No| Extract[Extract Final Solution]
    Extract --> End[End With Tool Selection]

    subgraph "Error Handling"
        Next -->|Error| Retry[Retry with Simplified Request]
        Retry -->|Success| AddRetry[Add to Context]
        Retry -->|Failure| FallbackEx[Extract Partial Solution]
        AddRetry --> Loop
        FallbackEx --> End
    end
```

## Session State Management

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Client Request] --> SessionID[Extract Session ID]
    SessionID --> Store{State Exists?}

    Store -->|Yes| Retrieve[Retrieve Previous State]
    Store -->|No| Create[Create New State]

    Retrieve --> Context[Add Context to Tool]
    Create --> NoContext[Execute Without Context]

    Context --> Execute[Execute Tool]
    NoContext --> Execute

    Execute --> SaveState[Update Session State]
    SaveState --> Response[Return Response to Client]

    subgraph "Session State Structure"
        State[SessionState] --> PrevCall[Previous Tool Call]
        State --> PrevResp[Previous Response]
        State --> Timestamp[Timestamp]
    end
```

## Workflow Execution Engine

The Workflow system enables multi-step sequences:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Client Request] --> Parse[Parse Workflow Request]
    Parse --> FindFlow[Find Workflow in workflows.json]
    FindFlow --> Steps[Extract Steps]

    Steps --> Loop[Process Each Step]
    Loop --> PrepInput[Prepare Step Input]
    PrepInput --> ExecuteTool[Execute Tool via Registry]
    ExecuteTool --> SaveOutput[Save Step Output]
    SaveOutput --> NextStep{More Steps?}

    NextStep -->|Yes| MapOutput[Map Output to Next Input]
    MapOutput --> Loop

    NextStep -->|No| FinalOutput[Prepare Final Output]
    FinalOutput --> End[Return Workflow Result]

    subgraph "Input/Output Mapping"
        MapOutput --> Direct[Direct Value]
        MapOutput --> Extract[Extract From Previous]
        MapOutput --> Transform[Transform Values]
    end
```

## Workflow Configuration

Workflows are defined in the `workflows.json` file located in the root directory of the project. This file contains predefined sequences of tool calls that can be executed with a single command.

### File Location and Structure

- The `workflows.json` file must be placed in the project root directory (same level as package.json)
- The file follows this structure:
  ```json
  {
    "workflows": {
      "workflowName1": {
        "description": "Description of what this workflow does",
        "inputSchema": {
          "param1": "string",
          "param2": "string"
        },
        "steps": [
          {
            "id": "step1_id",
            "toolName": "tool-name",
            "params": {
              "param1": "{workflow.input.param1}"
            }
          },
          {
            "id": "step2_id",
            "toolName": "another-tool",
            "params": {
              "paramA": "{workflow.input.param2}",
              "paramB": "{steps.step1_id.output.content[0].text}"
            }
          }
        ],
        "output": {
          "summary": "Workflow completed message",
          "details": ["Output line 1", "Output line 2"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Parameter Templates

Workflow step parameters support template strings that can reference:
- Workflow inputs: `{workflow.input.paramName}`
- Previous step outputs: `{steps.stepId.output.content[0].text}`

### Triggering Workflows

Use the `run-workflow` tool with:
```
Run the newProjectSetup workflow with input {"productDescription": "A task manager app"}
```

## Detailed Tool Documentation

Each tool in the `src/tools/` directory includes comprehensive documentation in its own README.md file. These files cover:

*   Tool overview and purpose
*   Input/output specifications
*   Workflow diagrams (Mermaid)
*   Usage examples
*   System prompts used
*   Error handling details

Refer to these individual READMEs for in-depth information:

*   `src/tools/fullstack-starter-kit-generator/README.md`
*   `src/tools/prd-generator/README.md`
*   `src/tools/research/README.md`
*   `src/tools/rules-generator/README.md`
*   `src/tools/task-list-generator/README.md`
*   `src/tools/user-stories-generator/README.md`
*   `src/tools/workflow-runner/README.md`
*   `src/tools/map-codebase/README.md`

## Tool Categories

### Analysis & Information Tools

*   **Code Map Tool (`map-codebase`)**: Scans a codebase to extract semantic information (classes, functions, comments) and generates either a human-readable Markdown map with Mermaid diagrams or a structured JSON representation with absolute file paths for imports and enhanced class property information.
*   **Context Curation Tool (`curate-context`)**: Intelligent codebase analysis and context package curation with 8-phase workflow pipeline, intelligent codemap caching, language-agnostic project detection supporting 35+ programming languages, and multi-strategy file discovery for AI-driven development tasks.
*   **Research Tool (`research`)**: Performs deep research on technical topics using Perplexity Sonar, providing summaries and sources.

### Planning & Documentation Tools

*   **Rules Generator (`generate-rules`):** Creates project-specific development rules and guidelines.
*   **PRD Generator (`generate-prd`):** Generates comprehensive product requirements documents.
*   **User Stories Generator (`generate-user-stories`):** Creates detailed user stories with acceptance criteria.
*   **Task List Generator (`generate-task-list`):** Builds structured development task lists with dependencies.

### Project Scaffolding Tool

*   **Fullstack Starter Kit Generator (`generate-fullstack-starter-kit`):** Creates customized project starter kits with specified frontend/backend technologies, including basic setup scripts and configuration.

### Workflow & Orchestration

*   **Workflow Runner (`run-workflow`):** Executes predefined sequences of tool calls for common development tasks.

## Generated File Storage

By default, outputs from the generator tools are stored for historical reference in the `VibeCoderOutput/` directory within the project. This location can be overridden by setting the `VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable in your `.env` file or AI assistant configuration.

### Security Boundaries for Read and Write Operations

For security reasons, the Vibe Coder MCP tools maintain separate security boundaries for read and write operations with a **security-by-default** approach:

* **Read Operations**:
  - **Code Map Tool**: Only reads from directories explicitly authorized through the `CODE_MAP_ALLOWED_DIR` environment variable
  - **Vibe Task Manager**: Only reads from directories authorized through the `VIBE_TASK_MANAGER_READ_DIR` environment variable (defaults to `process.cwd()`)
  - **Security Mode**: The Vibe Task Manager defaults to 'strict' security mode, which prevents access to system directories like `/private/var/spool/postfix/`, `/System/`, and other unauthorized paths
  - **Filesystem Security**: Comprehensive blacklist enforcement and permission checking prevent EACCES errors and unauthorized file access

* **Write Operations**: All output files are written to the `VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR` directory (or its subdirectories). This separation ensures that tools can only write to designated output locations, protecting your source code from accidental modifications.

* **Security Implementation**: The filesystem security system includes:
  - **Adaptive Timeout Management**: Prevents operations from hanging indefinitely with intelligent retry and cancellation
  - **Path Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all file paths before access
  - **Permission Checking**: Proactive permission verification to prevent access errors
  - **System Directory Protection**: Built-in blacklist of system directories that should never be accessed

## Running Locally (Optional)

While the primary use is integration with an AI assistant (using stdio), you can run the server directly for testing:

### Running Modes

*   **Production Mode (Stdio):**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    * Logs go to stderr (mimics AI assistant launch)
    * Use NODE_ENV=production

*   **Development Mode (Stdio, Pretty Logs):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    * Logs go to stdout with pretty formatting
    * Requires `nodemon` and `pino-pretty`
    * Use NODE_ENV=development

*   **SSE Mode (HTTP Interface):**
    ```bash
    # Production mode over HTTP
    npm run start:sse

    # Development mode over HTTP
    npm run dev:sse
    ```
    * Uses HTTP instead of stdio
    * Configured via PORT in .env (default: 3000)
    * Access at http://localhost:3000

## Detailed Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

#### MCP Server Not Detected in AI Assistant

1. **Check Configuration Path:**
   * Verify the absolute path in the `args` array is correct
   * Ensure all slashes are forward slashes `/` even on Windows
   * Run `node <path-to-build/index.js>` directly to test if Node can find it

2. **Check Configuration Format:**
   * Make sure JSON is valid without syntax errors
   * Check that commas between properties are correct
   * Verify that the `mcpServers` object contains your server

3. **Restart the Assistant:**
   * Completely close (not just minimize) the application
   * Reopen and try again

#### Server Starts But Tools Don't Work

1. **Check Disabled Flag:**
   * Ensure `"disabled": false` is set
   * Remove any `//` comments as JSON doesn't support them

2. **Verify autoApprove Array:**
   * Check that tool names in the `autoApprove` array match exactly
   * Try adding `"process-request"` to the array if using hybrid routing

### API Key Issues

1. **OpenRouter Key Problems:**
   * Double-check that the key is correctly copied
   * Verify the key is active in your OpenRouter dashboard
   * Check if you have sufficient credits

2. **Environment Variable Issues:**
   * Verify the key is correct in both:
     * The `.env` file (for local runs)
     * Your AI assistant's configuration env block

### Path & Permission Issues

1. **Build Directory Not Found:**
   * Run `npm run build` to ensure the build directory exists
   * Check if build output is going to a different directory (check tsconfig.json)

2. **File Permission Errors:**
   * Ensure your user has write access to the workflow-agent-files directory
   * On Unix systems, check if build/index.js has execute permission

### Log Debugging

1. **For Local Runs:**
   * Check the console output for error messages
   * Try running with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your `.env` file

2. **For AI Assistant Runs:**
   * Set `"NODE_ENV": "production"` in the env configuration
   * Check if the assistant has a logging console or output window

### Tool-Specific Issues

1. **Semantic Routing Not Working:**
   * First run may download embedding model - check for download messages
   * Try a more explicit request that mentions the tool name
