echo "  - Code Generation & Refactoring Tools"
echo "  - Analysis Tools (Dependencies, Git Summary)"

echo "1. If you haven't already, **edit the .env file** to add your valid OPENROUTER_API_KEY."
echo "2. Review the default models in \`.env\` (GEMINI_MODEL, PERPLEXITY_MODEL) and ensure they fit your needs/OpenRouter plan."
echo "3. Review workflow definitions in \`workflows.json\` if you plan to use the \`run-workflow\` tool."
echo "4. To run the server (using stdio for Claude Desktop): npm start"
echo "5. To run the server (using SSE on http://localhost:3000): npm run start:sse"
echo "6. For Claude Desktop integration, update its MCP settings using the current \`mcp-config.json\` and ensure the path in Claude's config points to \`build/index.js\`."
echo "7. Use the 'get-job-result' tool to retrieve outcomes from long-running asynchronous tasks."
